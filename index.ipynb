    "# Proof of Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof-of-work is simply the double-sha256 of the block header. If this number, interpreted as a little-endian integer is lower than the target, we have a valid proof-of-work. If not, the block is not valid. Note that this is very easy to check. All we need to calculate is a single double-sha256 to check. On the other hand, creating the proof-of-work is really difficult. We would need to calculate on average X number of double-sha256 hashes at a difficulty of Y. This is what we would call an asymmetric problem and the reason why proof-of-work is an effective way to measure that the block producer has expended a sufficient amount of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a reason why this process is likened to mining. It takes roughly 2-90 tons of processing dirt and rock in order to find a single ounce of gold. In the same way, we have to process lots of numerical dirt and rock in order to find a proof-of-work. Proof-of-work is rare and uniformly distributed, making finding one just as difficult with one type of header versus another."
